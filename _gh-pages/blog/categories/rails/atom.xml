    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've previously covered <a href="/blog/2018/02/02/artsy-apogee/">what Apogee is</a> and <a href="/blog/2018/01/24/kubernetes-and-hokusai/">how it's deployed</a>, so all that's left to cover is the technology used to build it. As a refresher: Apogee is a Google Sheets Add-on we built to help our Auctions Ops team transform the data given to us by our partners into a format that our CMS can understand. This process, done manually up until now, takes a long time and is a perfect candidate for automation.</p>

<p>Apogee had some really interesting technical challenges that I enjoyed solving, and I'm excited to share some lessons I learned. So let's dive in!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We built a prototype as a "pure" Add-on, written only inside Google's sandbox, but that approach wouldn't work for us in production: the Add-on environment was just too difficult to work with. Google expects you to write Add-ons in their in-browser <a href="http://script.google.com">Script Editor</a> and – while whether or not that editor is <em>good</em> is a matter of preference – the environment isn't suited for collaborating or unit testing. Additionally, we could not get Add-on deploys automated, so we'd like to minimize how often we <em>have</em> to deploy.</p>

<p>So we split things up. Instead of building all Apogee's logic into an Add-on, we decided to build two pieces: a very thin Add-on and a Rails server with all the real logic.</p>

<p>(Because Apogee necessarily includes information about how our partners format their data, we decided not to open source it. Data formats are <em>probably</em> not sensitive, but that's a judgement best left up to our partners.)</p>

<a name="Apogee.Add-on"></a>
<h2>Apogee Add-on</h2>

<p>The Add-on we built is very simple, by design. Our goal was to make an Add-on that was flexible enough such that we would need to deploy it less frequently than adding new parsers.</p>

<p>Add-on responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>fetching the available parsers from the server.</li>
<li>setting up an Add-on user interface (a menu of partners, each with available parsers).</li>
<li>responding to invocations from that interface.</li>
</ul>


<p>Based on the parser selected by the user, Apogee gathers the required data from the current spreadsheet, sends it to the server for processing, and appends the results to the sheet. Pretty straightforward, you'd think.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Google Add-ons are a bit... strange. The Add-on itself is executed in Google's datacentres (not the user's browser) and is written in <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/#basic_javascript_features">JavaScript 1.6-ish</a>. Specifically, it runs with JavaScript 1.6, plus some features from 1.7, plus some other features from 1.8, and also <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/advanced">"Google Advanced Services"</a>. The execution environment also lacks an event loop, which makes sense from Google's perspective (their servers need to know if a script execution has completed) but is still a bit unusual.</p>

<p>Rather than deal with a weird version of JavaScript, we decided to write the Add-on in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> and compile down to something Google can execute. We also found <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/google-apps-script">open source typings</a> for the Google APIs, which helped a lot. Google also provides access to certain whitelisted libraries, including <a href="https://lodash.com">Lodash</a>, which is handy.</p>

<p>Add-ons also have a somewhat complex permissions and authentication model. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/lifecycle">documentation</a> provided is a great illustration of why <em>complete</em> documentation is not necessarily <em>effective</em> documentation. If you already understand what you're doing, the docs are a good reference, but I found them difficult to learn from. I really like <a href="https://twitter.com/kosamari/status/852319140060823553">this explanation</a> of how to structure documentation like unit tests.</p>

<p>Permissions vary wildly depending on the execution context. For example, the <code>onOpen</code> callback is able to make network requests when the script is run as an attachment to a spreadsheet, but not when deployed. This makes it difficult to populate our menu UI, which is based off an API response. I learned to not have confidence everything was working until I saw it work end-to-end.</p>

<p>One other peculiarity of Google's API is how UI callbacks work. You could create a menu for your Add-on with the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="js">SpreadsheetApp.getUi()
  .createAddonMenu()
  .addItem('Do something', 'doSomething')
  .addToUi()

function doSomething() {
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice that the callback function is specified by a <em>string</em> representing a function name (and not as a function itself, which would be more idiomatic). So, for every menu item, there must exist a corresponding function in the global scope with a corresponding name. Sadly, no parameters are passed to these callbacks, so it's impossible for a function to determine which menu item it was invoked by. Therefore, every menu item <em>must</em> have exactly <em>one</em> corresponding function. That presents a problem for an Add-on with a dynamic menu.</p>

<p>The Add-on isn't executed in a browser; we're running on Google's datacentres so let's just brute-force this. Our menu is a list of partner names, which is itself a submenu of parsers specific to that partner. That means that each menu item (and corresponding callback) can be indexed by two integers: a partner index and a operation index. So now we have a way to map from our user interface to a specific operation to perform inside <em>one</em> common menu handler.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the actual code.</p>

<pre><code class="ts">interface Operation {
  name: string
  columns: string[]
  token: string
}

interface Partner {
  name: string
  operations: Operation[]
}

// Sets up the Add-on menu and submenus.
function setupAddon(ui: Partner[]) {
  // Reduce the ui to a list of submenus.
  const addOnMenu = ui.reduce((menu, partner, partnerIndex) =&gt; {
    // Reduce the operations list to a list of menu items.
    return menu.addSubMenu(partner.operations.reduce((memo, operation, operationIndex) =&gt; {
      return memo.addItem(operation.name, `partner${partnerIndex}Operation${operationIndex}`)
    }, SpreadsheetApp.getUi().createMenu(partner.name)))
  }, SpreadsheetApp.getUi().createAddonMenu())
  // Add the generated menu to the Add-on UI.
  addOnMenu.addToUi()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each menu has a callback function named something like <code>partnerXOperationY</code>. Then we just generated a few thousand functions that match that format and call a shared handler <em>with</em> <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> as parameters. The generated code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="js">function partner0Operation0() {
    sharedHandler(0, 0);
}
function partner0Operation1() {
    sharedHandler(0, 1);
}
function partner0Operation2() {
    sharedHandler(0, 2);
}

function sharedHandler(partnerIndex, operationIndex) {
    // TODO: Look up the appropriate parser to use.
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's not elegant, but it works. Actually, I think it does have a certain elegance, given the constraints it has to operate within.</p>

<p>So that's it! The rest of the challenges were just weird permissions issues or config problems, but the Add-on was pretty easy to build. The file generated by the TypeScript compiler is only 166 lines long, and the file with all our menu callbacks is "only" 8000 lines long. Next, let's talk about the server.</p>

<a name="Apogee.Server"></a>
<h2>Apogee Server</h2>

<p>So, Rails' philosophy is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">convention over configuration</a>", which is pretty great as long as you know the conventions. I'd never run <code>rails new</code> before. Also, that philosophy works best when you're building <em>conventional</em> apps. Because Apogee is a bit unconventional, I was going to write Apogee in Sinatra before my colleague suggested I use Rails in <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html">API-only mode</a> instead. It seemed a bit overkill, but I also didn't want to pass up the chance to finally learn Rails.</p>

<p>The server has two endpoints:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/ui</code> provides a list of partners and their respective parsers.</li>
<li><code>/columns</code> accepts spreadsheet columns and returns processed data (cell contents and a background colour to indicate our confidence in parsed results).</li>
</ul>


<p>We needed a way for the server to specify all its operations in a way that they could be invoked through the second endpoint. We decided to use a token-based approach: each parser has a token that can be used to invoke the parser later on. This dovetails with how I structured the parsers, too.</p>

<p>Each partner is defined by a submodule within the <code>Apogee::Parser</code> module, and each parser is defined by a class within that partner module. Let's take a look at some code.</p>

<pre><code class="rb">module Apogee
  module Parser
    module Skinner
      extend Apogee::BaseParser

      class DimensionsParser
        # Name to show in Add-on UI.
        def self.menu_name
          "Parse dimensions from Description column"
        end

        # Columns required by the `/columns` endpoint.
        def self.column_names
          %w[Description]
        end

        # Parse the columns, called from the `/columns` endpoint.
        def self.parse(columns)
          # TODO: parse the columns.
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Each class within a partner is expected to have those three class methods.</p>

<p>So now that we have a defined structure for our parsers, we can use Ruby reflection to collect a list of partner modules:</p>

<pre><code class="rb">Parser.constants
  .select { |c| Parser.const_get(c).is_a? Module }
  .map do |c|
    {
      name: c,
      operations: Parser.const_get(c).public_parsers
    }
end
</code></pre>

<p>Each module also has a <code>public_parsers</code> function (inherited from <code>Apogee::BaseParser</code>) which also uses reflection:</p>

<pre><code class="rb">def public_parsers
  constants
    .select { |c| const_get(c).is_a? Class }
    .map { |c| const_get(c) }
    .map do |klass|
      {
        klass: klass.to_s,
        name: klass.menu_name,
        columns: klass.column_names,
        token: Digest::SHA256.base64digest(klass.to_s)
      }
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This code collects all the Ruby classes inside a module into a data structure that can be consumed by the Apogee Add-on through the <code>/ui</code> endpoint. As a bonus, the tokens are generated from the SHA256 hash of the fully-qualified parser class names. And we also avoid having to maintain a separate list of parsers that I would inevitably forget to update. Win-win.</p>

<p>All that's left to do is to lookup a parser class from a token. This is as easy as finding the class with the matching token and calling its <code>parse</code> function.</p>

<pre><code class="rb">parser = partners
  .map { |p| p[:operations] }
  .flatten
  .find { |op| op[:token] == token }
Object.const_get(parser[:klass]).parse(columns)
</code></pre>

<p>Neat!</p>

<p>This approach is <em>good</em>, but strikes me as overly object-oriented. <em>Most</em> of the parsers we're going to write are going to do the same thing: they have the same three methods and the <code>parse</code> method is basically just matching each spreadsheet cell against a regular expression. We can make a better abstraction.</p>

<p>Since the parsers are defined by the presence of a class within a partner module, we can use metaprogramming to abstract away all the common pieces and add classes to the module programmatically. The implementation is too in-depth to explain in detail here, but our partner module above could be rewritten to look like the following:</p>

<pre><code class="rb">module Apogee
  module Parser
    module Skinner
      extend Apogee::BaseParser

      add_single_column_parser(
        class_name: 'DimensionsParser',
        menu_name: 'Parse dimensions from Description column',
        column_name: 'Description',
        regex: %r{REGEX GOES HERE},
        new_columns: %w[Height Width Depth Unit]
      ) do |match|
        # TODO: Process each cell.
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I created two such methods: one that uses a single regex, and another that uses multiple regexes (for more complex needs). I also wrote a handy <code>add_all_parser</code> method which adds a sort of meta-parser, which collates the results from calling <code>parse</code> on all the <em>other</em> parsers in that module. Our Ops team just needs to click "Parse everything" and the entire spreadsheet is processed with all the parsers in seconds.</p>

<p>And of course, since all our parsers are just Ruby classes, they were easy to unit test.</p>

<p>I've done metaprogramming in other languages, and it was a lot of fun to use it in Ruby. I ran the code by my colleagues who are more experienced in Ruby than I am, and documented everything thoroughly. It's a real shame the codebase isn't open source, because I'm really proud of the approach and would love to share it with you.</p>

<a name="Apogee.Authentication"></a>
<h2>Apogee Authentication</h2>

<p>We needed to make sure that only the Add-on itself was invoking the server's endpoints. Not because the server has sensitive data – Apogee's server has no database and doesn't access any APIs – but just because it's good practice to limit access to services to only who needs them.</p>

<p>We evaluated a bunch of prospective auth strategies, including (but not limited to) the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Whitelist Google datacentre IP addresses, block all others.</li>
<li>HTTP Basic Auth.</li>
<li>Shared secret.</li>
<li>OAuth with Artsy's API, by the user upon Add-on installation.</li>
<li>Something totally custom, or a combination of any of these.</li>
</ul>


<p>After thoughtful discussion, we decided on a solution that works for us. I'm not going to specify what we used – not because I'm that concerned about the security, but because each project and team will have their own needs. If you build a server, think carefully about what kind of authentication makes sense for you and your team.</p>

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Apogee was a really fun project. It had a defined scope, so it was a good first Rails project for me to tackle. The Add-on helps my colleagues on the Auctions Ops team do their jobs easier, so it was intrinsically rewarding to build. And it turns out that our Gallery Partnerships team also has to import a lot of partner data into Artsy's CMS, so I'm now exploring ways Apogee can help them, too.</p>

<p>As a closing note, I want to discuss something that's been on my mind lately. I've been developing iOS apps <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/5-years-of-ios/">since 2009</a>, and have a <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/books/">very intimate knowledge</a> of Objective-C, Swift, and UIKit. For a long time, I actually avoided learning new languages and frameworks because they intimidated me – starting over in a new framework, from scratch, felt like a step backward.</p>

<p>I think this is a common frame of mind, among iOS developers, among all developers. But now I regret avoiding new technology for so long. The languages and tools that I knew had become part of my identity: I was an "iOS Developer." That identity was a source of strength, but was also a limitation.</p>

<p>Developers solve problems. Sometimes those problems are best solved with iOS apps. And sometimes, they're best solved with spreadsheet plugins. After <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/swift-vs-react-native-feels/">realizing</a> last year that I was limiting myself, I'm still coming to terms with how that impacts my identity. But I'll say this: if <em>I</em> can leave the safety blanket of the iOS world and build something completely new, so can you. Don't let your expertise and experience limit what you think you can build.</p>

    <link href="https://www.theballot.com/blog/2018/02/02/artsy-apogee/"/>
    <updated>2018-02-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.theballot.com/blog/2018/02/02/artsy-apogee</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Apogee: the point in the orbit of two objects at which they are furthest apart.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 2017, the Artsy Auctions Operations team coordinated and ran 190+ sales on our platform. This year, our ambitions are set even higher. But scaling up the number of sales we run will require scaling up our tools and processes, too. This post describes Apogee, a tool I built to help us scale our businesses processes. I never thought I would be so excited to build a spreadsheet plugin, but I honestly had a blast. So let's dive in!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Running a sale on Artsy is no small feat. I mean, after all the contract negotiations you might think things get easier, but that's just the beginning of the work. All our auction partners have data in their own CMS systems, and they're all formatted slightly differently. We need to get the information for each lot in a sale into Artsy's CMS, and so a few years ago we built a batch-import app in Rails to do this (closed source, sorry). It works well, but expects data in a specific format.</p>

<p>A lot of work is done by our Ops team to reformat spreadsheets they get from our partners to match the structure our batch import tool expects. All of our partners have different formats, and sales can include hundreds of lots. The reformatting process can take one person over a day, for large sales.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be cool to build some kind of server to bridge the gulf between Artsy's database and our partner's myriad systems?</p>

<p>No, actually, it wouldn't. It would be a tremendous amount of work, from our side and from theirs. Back to the drawing board.</p>

<p>In January, Ops arranged a meeting between us engineers and an auction partner. Ideally, a solution to <em>our</em> problem would also make our partners' lives easier, since exporting data from their systems is sometimes as arduous as importing it into ours. <a href="https://www.skinnerinc.com">Skinner</a> was kind enough to walk us through their export process and provide us with some representative data.</p>

<p>Perfect, now we have a starting point.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>If you're not familiar the 80/20 rule says, ‘Do a job until it's 80% done and then quit’.
—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSgR-hJjdTo#t=2m36s">@searls</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The team's early brainstorming to the Ops import workflow was hampered by a kind of perfectionism. We evaluated, but decided against solutions because they didn't address all the edge cases. It finally clicked, for me anyway, when I realized that our tool didn't need to bridge the gulf between two <em>systems</em>, but between two <em>workflows</em>.</p>

<p>And it didn't need to be perfect, not at all. Even an 80% reduction in the amount of time spent wrangling spreadsheet data would translate to <em>hours</em> of time saved, per sale. That is, if we could find a way to make it ridiculously easy to add parsers for new partners.</p>

<p>We built a quick prototype – less than two days work – to pull out data from Skinner's spreadsheets and format it into the structure that's easiest to import into Artsy. The prototype itself was a <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/">Google Sheets Add-on</a>. There will be a follow-up post describing the technical evolution of this tool, but the important thing to note here is that we engineers had to go to where our Ops team already was. Previous discussions around improving Ops' import workflows were centred around building entirely new workflows instead of improving the existing, functional workflows.</p>

<p>The prototype was tested in production with two large sales Skinner and Artsy were running together. Parsing out <em>just</em> the dimensions of the lots, for <em>just</em> one of the sales, saved an hour of Ops' time. Clearly, there was promise in this tool.</p>

<p>Next steps were all technical, and we'll get into details in the next post, but building Apogee actually involved developing two pieces of technology: a Rails server, and an Add-on client. Because a tool to parse data from various partners necessarily contains those partners' data formats, we decided not to open source Apogee. That's okay – we practice <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/open-source-ideology/">open source <em>by default</em></a>, not <em>by demand</em>.</p>

<a name="Apogee.Server"></a>
<h2>Apogee Server</h2>

<p>It's difficult to discuss the server without first talking about the Add-on, so in short: Add-ons are difficult to maintain, to collaborate on, to unit test, and so on. So we decided early to build a very thin Add-on client and move all the heavy lifting to a backend server that we could develop within our existing technical framework. Our goal was to build an Add-on that needed to be updated less frequently than support for new partners was added.</p>

<p>We needed a server. Most of this server's job was going to be running regular expressions, and Ruby's regex features are still a step above Node's. It's critical that writing new parsers be <em>ridiculously</em> easy to write (and test!). That factored in a lot of technical decisions, which we'll discuss in more detail in the next Apogee post.</p>

<p>So it's a Ruby server, but which framework?</p>

<p>I thought about using Sinatra, since our server is very simple and Sinatra is a tech I've <a href="https://github.com/Moya/Aeryn">used before</a>, but after speaking with some colleagues, I decided on using Rails in API-only mode. Sticking to Rails would keep the project in-step with the rest of Artsy's Ruby server code – we don't have any Sinatra apps, but everyone here already knows Rails. Plus, Rails is <em>very</em> boring and – consequently – <em>very</em> stable. I like stability.</p>

<p>Before a few weeks ago, I'd never even run <code>rails new</code>. Now, I'm the proud point-person for an entire Rails server. I owe a lot to my colleagues for helping me along the way.</p>

<a name="Apogee.Add-on"></a>
<h2>Apogee Add-on</h2>

<p>The Add-on is an interesting piece of code. In addition to the strange environment for building and deploying Add-ons, you also have to deal with a strange runtime. How strange? Well, it's JavaScript, but not as we know it.</p>

<p>Google Docs Add-ons run as <a href="https://script.google.com">Google Scripts</a>, which are a more general-purpose cloud computing platform. They <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/#basic_javascript_features">execute a runtime</a> based on JavaScript 1.6, which specific features from JavaScripts 1.7 and 1.8 ported in. Similar to the <a href="http://danger.systems/js/">Danger-JS</a> 1.x runtime, there is no event loop. So, things are weird.</p>

<p>Just because we can't fully automate deploys doesn't mean we can't automate <em>parts</em> of the process. Specifically, I built the Add-on using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> which is compiled down to a version of JavaScript that Google Scripts plays nice with. There are even open-source <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/google-apps-script">typings</a> available for the Google Scripts API.</p>

<hr />

<p>I learned a lot from building Apogee, from a technical perspective, but the lessons I'm most proud of learning have to do more with business processes. From the general approach of making data imports faster, to the specific programming languages used to build Apogee, all decisions were driven first and foremost by actual business needs (and not technology trends). Apogee is not exciting enough to make the front page of Hacker News, and in a weird way, I'm proud of that.</p>

<p>Artsy Auctions are at an inflection point; we need to scale up the number of auctions we run faster than we scale up the effort spends actually running them. 2018 is going to challenge the Auctions engineering team to help our colleagues accomplish more, while doing less. I'm excited for that challenge.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When dealing with rendering data for an email, one frequently has to make many database calls to assemble the required data. This can be slow, and depending on how you structure the code that is assembling the data vs rendering the data in a template, it's very easy to be making repeated calls, which can significantly slow down your process. Additionally, whether you are using <a href="http://haml.info/">Haml</a>, <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>, <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a>, or any other templating language, embedding too much logic in the template can making things hard to maintain (especially if some logic lives in the template and some elsewhere in your domain code). Of course some logic in the template (a conditional: should I render this section?, or loops: render this hash of data) is necessary, but I like to keep as much out of there as possible. It's easier to optimize, debug and maintain that logic elsewhere, and also writing complex logic in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> is much more fun than in a templating language!</p>

<p>In this article I'll present what I've been doing to keep my templates relatively logic-free, and how I make sure I don't repeat any heavy database calls in assembling my data.</p>

<a name="The.Setup.-.Presenters.and.Memoization"></a>
<h2>The Setup - Presenters and Memoization</h2>

<p>First, I'd like to introduce the Presenter pattern, and how this can help clean up your templates. Here are a couple of links about using presenters with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> that I've found useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2007/03/rails-presenter-pattern.html">Jay Fields' Guide to Presenters</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mdesjardins/presenters-in-rails">Mike Desjardins' Slideshare Presentation</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Consider the following screenshot of a section of a weekly email that we send our users:</p>

<p>This section shows works that have been added that week by artists that you follow. That's clearly going to involve some database calls, and potentially heavy ones at that. Now we'd like to accomplish two things here: we want to make sure that we only make these calls once (no matter what we wind up doing with the data later), and we also would like to make sure that any code or logic that is making these calls and doing any data manipulation is not being done directly in our templates. Keeping this kind of logic out of your template will make it easier to debug, maintain and write.</p>

<p>Let's start by creating a Module to hold the various logic required for this email:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class WeeklyEmailPresenter
  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so far so good. In our mail template rendering/calling code, we can now say:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">@presenter = WeeklyEmailPresenter.new(user)
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow us to refer to methods in this class in our mail template. So now let's add a method that will query our database and return a list of artists that this user should be notified about:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class WeeklyEmailPresenter
  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def recently_added_works
    # Some really heavy database query
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, that was easy. In our HAML template, we can now do:</p>

<pre><code class="haml">-if @presenter.recently_added_works &amp;&amp; @presenter.recently_added_works.any?
  %table
    %tr
      %td
        -@presenter.recently_added_works.each do |artists|
          &lt;!-- markup to render each artist with recently added works --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, take a look at how many times we've referred to <code>@presenter.recently_added_works</code> - 3 times already! And we'll most likely refer to it more elsewhere (perhaps when deriving a subject line, or showing a total count somewhere, etc.). Depending on how you've implemented the method <code>recently_added_works</code>, you may be re-querying the database every time it's referred to! Clearly that's a lot of wasted resources. So, let's look at an easy change that will guarantee we only ever perform the work to assemble this data once. We memoize it:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class WeeklyEmailPresenter
  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def recently_added_works
    @recently_added_works ||= build_recently_added_works
  end

  private

  def build_recently_added_works
    # Code to do database lookups
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>All we're doing is moving the actual code that's doing the heavy lifting into a <code>private</code> method (for convention, I like to prefix the name with <code>build_</code>). The public method that we refer to elsewhere in our presenter and template simply calls the appropriate <code>private</code> method. Through using an instance variable combined with conditional assignment, we guarantee that the <code>build_</code> method (our heavy and slow workhorse method) will only be called once, no matter how many times we refer to the public method.</p>

<p>That's it! To summarize, use instance variables in your public methods which is what your templates and other code will use. Those public methods should call private <code>build_</code> methods which actually do all the heavy lifting. This way, you get to easily move logic away from a template and into its own module, and can guarantee that you're not repeating any long-running database queries or other slow data processing.</p>

<p>Hopefully you've found this a useful pattern to follow, please leave any feedback in the comments and <a href="https://github.com/artsy">follow us on Github</a>!</p>

    <updated>2013-04-13T12:21:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.theballot.com/blog/2013/04/13/bootstrapping-json-data-with-rails-and-backbone-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://artsy.net">artsy.net website</a> is a Backbone.js application that talks to a server-side RESTful Grape API sitting on top of a Rails app which serves minimal HTML markup. The latter includes such things as a page title, along with links to JavaScript and stylesheet packages. A page loads, scripts run, data is fetched from the API. The result is merged into a HAMLJS template and rendered client-side.</p>

<p>Building this kind of one-page apps allows for clean separation between the presentation and API layers. The downside is that it will slow page render times - fetching data after page load means waiting for an AJAX request to complete before displaying anything.</p>

<p>There're many solutions to this problem, all involving some kind of server-side rendering. You could, for example, share views and JavaScript between client and server. This would be a major paradigm shift for a large application like ours and not something we could possibly maneuver in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Without changing the entire architecture of the system, how can we bootstrap JSON data server-side and avoid the data roundtrip on every page load?</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Model.Repository"></a>
<h3>Model Repository</h3>

<p>First, we need to keep track of our objects on the client. We've implemented a simple data repository. It ensures that the same model is passed around instead of instantiating new models each time. This helps prevent unnecessary trips to the server, and makes sure events are bound to the same model instance.</p>

<pre><code class="coffeescript">App.Repository =

  # Gets a model from the repository or fetches it from the server.
  getOrFetch: (id, options) -&gt;
    model = @get(id)
    if model?
      options?.success? options, model
      model
    else
      model = new @model({ id: id })
      model.fetch options
      @add model
    model

# Function to extend a collection in to a repository
App.Repository.extend = (collectionClass) -&gt;
  collection = new collectionClass
  repository = _.extend collection, App.Repository
  repository.collectionClass = collectionClass
  repository
</code></pre>

<p>Objects of the same type are stored together in a repository collection.</p>

<pre><code class="coffeescript">class App.Collections.Artists extends Backbone.Collection

  model: App.Models.Artist
  App.Repositories.Artists = App.Repository.extend @
</code></pre>

<a name="Fetching.Data"></a>
<h3>Fetching Data</h3>

<p>A view requires data before it can be rendered. For example, navigating to <a href="https://artsy.net/artist/hendrik-kerstens">artsy.net/artist/hendrik-kerstens</a> (a Dutch photographer who obsessively took pictures of his daughter in all kinds of artificial setups for 20 years) will call the following.</p>

<pre><code class="coffeescript">class App.Views.ArtistView extends Backbone.View

  render: -&gt;

    App.Repositories.Artists.getOrFetch @options.artistId,
      success: (artist) =&gt;
        @$el.html(JST['templates/artist/show']({ artist: artist }))
</code></pre>

<a name="Bootstrapping.Data"></a>
<h3>Bootstrapping Data</h3>

<p>Since our implementation sits on top of a Rails app, we can now bootstrap the data in a server-side Rails view without any JavaScript code changes. The following example lives in <code>app/views/artists/_bootstrap.html.haml</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">:javascript
  var json = $.parseJSON("#{j @artist.to_json}")
  App.Repositories.Artists.add(new App.Models.Artist(json));
</code></pre>

<p>You must encode JSON data inside a Rails template, otherwise unicode characters like U+2028 become actual line-endings. This has been discussed <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2965293/javascript-parse-error-on-u2028-unicode-character">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9691611/print-valid-non-escaped-json-in-a-view-with-rails">here</a>. The <code>j</code> above is an alias for <code>escape_javascript</code>.</p>

<p>The Rails view layout calls <code>yield :javascript</code> and the <code>show.html.haml</code> template includes the bootstrapped data as a partial.</p>

<pre><code class="haml">= content_for :javascript do
  = render partial: "artists/bootstrap"
</code></pre>

<p>The generated HTML includes the escaped JSON representation of the artist, which will be parsed client-side when the page loads and inserted into <code>App.Repositories.Artists</code>. The <code>App.Views.ArtistView</code> will no longer need to fetch the data from the server with an AJAX call.</p>

    <link href="https://www.theballot.com/blog/2012/03/06/how-to-redirect-bang-hash-urls/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-06T09:02:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.theballot.com/blog/2012/03/06/how-to-redirect-bang-hash-urls</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you type a hash-bang URL too fast, bang first.</p>

<p>Consider <code>https://artsy.net/!#/log_in</code>. Rails will receive <code>/!</code> as the file path, resulting in a 404, File Not Found error. The part of the URL after the hash is a position within the page and is never sent to the web server.</p>

<p>It's actually pretty easy to handle this scenario and redirect to the corresponding hash-bang URL.</p>

<p>The most straightforward way is to create a file called <code>!.html</code> in your <code>public</code> folder and use JavaScript to rewrite the URL with the bang-hash.</p>

<pre><code class="html public/!.html">&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  Click &lt;a href="#" onclick="return window.redirect();"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you're not redirected ...
  &lt;script language="javascript"&gt;
    window.redirect = function() {
      window.location = '/#!' + window.location.hash.substring(1)
      return false;
    }
    window.redirect();
  &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also do this inside a controller with a view or layout. Start by trapping the URL in your <code>ApplicationController</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby app/controllers/application_controller.rb">if request.env['PATH_INFO'] == '/!'
  render layout: "bang_hash"
  return
end
</code></pre>

<p>The layout can have the piece of JavaScript that redirects to the corresponding hash-bang URL.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby app/views/layouts/bang_hash.html.haml">!!!
- ie_tag(:html) do
  %body
    :javascript
      window.location = '/#!' + window.location.hash.substring(1)
</code></pre>
